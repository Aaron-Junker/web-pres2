Things to work on

- Stupid IE does not support fixed positioned div elements
  Emulate it using Javascript.
  See: http://javascriptkit.com/javatutors/static3.shtml
  Or perhaps stick the navbar in a frame on IE.  Note though that
  IE on the Mac does support fixed positioned div elements.

- This thing probably needs a name

- Calling all ming hackers - help us with some cool transitions for the navbar
  and also the various individual slide components if people choose to use
  the flash version.

- We also need to pretty up the navbar flash widget.  All sorts of slick
  things could be done in this thing.

- A cooler help page would be nice.

- a pop-up list of slide titles would be good so at any time during a
  presentation you could get the list and navigate to any slide by 
  clicking somewhere on the list.  Perhaps some Javascript trickery is
  required for the HTML navbar.  For the flash one, just a new key event
  will do the trick.

- Perhaps a pop-up widget to change $baseFontSize on the fly?  The base font
  size that works on one machine may not work at all on another.  So a quick
  way to change it would be cool.  The nice thing about the system is that
  everything is relative to the baseFontSize, so there is only one value to
  change.

- Perhaps a set of suggested fonts for various browsers would be a good idea 
  as well.

- make all hard-coded settings (like border padding) configurable on a per-presentation
  basis.	

- Go through each XML tag and make sure the attributes are implemented and 
  consistent across all display modes.  And at the same time, document each
  tag in the intro presentation.

- Still need to write the PDF code for the TABLE tag
