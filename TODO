Things to work on

- Make the presentation listing page in index.php pretty.  Perhaps
  add (+) buttons out in front of each one, and when clicked you 
  would get a list of slides inside that presentation? (james)

- Stupid IE does not support fixed positioned div elements
  Emulate it using Javascript.

  Or perhaps stick the navbar in a frame on IE.  Note though that
  IE on the Mac does support fixed positioned div elements.

- This thing probably needs a name

- We need a way to print presentations nicely.  This might be done through
  a conversion to Docbook-XML and then use all the existing tools to print
  from there.  Or perhaps some other converter.  Basically, I figure, it 
  would just be another set of rendering methods in objects.php
	-- What about generating PDF from HTML? (james)

- Calling all ming hackers - help us with some cool transitions for the navbar
  and also the various individual slide components if people choose to use
  the flash version.

- We also need to pretty up the navbar flash widget.  All sorts of slick
  things could be done in this thing.

- A cooler help page would be nice.

- a pop-up list of slide titles would be good so at any time during a
  presentation you could get the list and navigate to any slide by 
  clicking somewhere on the list.  Perhaps some Javascript trickery is
  required for the HTML navbar.  For the flash one, just a new key event
  will do the trick.

- HTML navbar is working with mouse-clicks only right now.  I think we can
  come up with some fancy Javascript to catch key events correctly.  The idea
  is to write a onKey handler which would check the event.pageX and event.pageY
  coordinates to see if the cursor is near the top of the page and if not, 
  send the keypress back to the browser.  On IE it is event.clientX and
  event.clientY instead, I think.  Not entirely sure this is possible, but
  it should be a fun little project.

- Perhaps a pop-up widget to change $baseFontSize on the fly?  The base font
  size that works on one machine may not work at all on another.  So a quick
  way to change it would be cool.  The nice thing about the system is that
  everything is relative to the baseFontSize, so there is only one value to
  change.

- Perhaps a set of suggested fonts for various browsers would be a good idea 
  as well.

- make all hard-coded settings (like border padding) configurable on a per-presentation
  basis.
